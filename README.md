Fun projects to keep busy.

I am a graduate student at Columbia University, studying Applied Analytics, and I am a marketing analyst in New York. 

I intend to use this repository to publish simple machine learning exercizes to dive deeper into the design behind the machine-learning packaged algorithms we commonly use. 

I will also publish functions to execute useful data transformations (e.g. Query string -> pandas.DataFrame, pandas.DataFrame -> html table(string), etc..). I think data transformations of these sorts can grow into a useful Python package.

Most of this repository will be in Python, but R projects aren't out of the question.
